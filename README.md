An italian keyboard layout for Windows that mimics the Italian layout for Ubuntu

## Why?

The italian layout for Windows is just nonsensical, especially for coders.
In order to input common characters like tilde (~) or backtick (\`) one has
to resort to grotesque `ALT+[nnn]` combinations.

Another missing feature is how caps lock reacts to accented characters; a lower caps
accented character (like `è`) is already on the keyboard physucak layout, but you can't produce
an upper caps `È` with `shift` key - Ubuntu though allows to obtain `È` through the
use of caps lock. This is absent in Windows

## How?

* Download the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (MSKLC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134)
* Install the software
* Clone this repo or download the `.klc` file
* Generate a layout from the source
* Use Windows preferences to select this layout
